# Genetic-Programming-Binary-Encoding

This project builds on the problem solved in Project #1, implementing binary (bit-string) encoding for the solution. The main objective is to use binary encoding for variables $x1, $x2, and $x3, and to evaluate the algorithm's performance across multiple runs.
